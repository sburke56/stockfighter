## chock_a_block

The trick here I think is to peg the price of the stock where you want
so issue buys at the small block price lower than the market, so there
is demand for that price point & the sellers come down to it.  When
the price comes down low enough issue the larger block buy.

This has to be done "slowly" and I adjusted the times accordingly to
space out the large block buys.

This assumes that the market is moving with you since it is pegging
the stock at a price under the last quoted value.  So if the market is
moving away from you & the quote is too high this strategy falls flat.
I'm not sure if I should be able to beat the bot consistently and I
haven't looked in the forums yet in case of spoilers.
